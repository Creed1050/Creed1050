I am a member of the USAF and a recent cybersecurity graduate with a profound interest in technology, information security and a dedication to constant learning.

## Objective


My journey in the USAF has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join an organization that is willing to take me under their wing and continue to develop me as a cybersecurity professional.
